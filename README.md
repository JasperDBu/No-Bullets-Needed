# No-Bullets-Needed
## Description
This is a 2D rougelike shooter game that uses the Unity Game Engine. The concept of our game is a lone cowboy drifting in the wild west, but suddenly he gets taken to a fantasy world. With no bullets in his gun he must survive. Our protagonist is given a special glove that can take magic and convert it into bullets. Using his new found power, he must find a way back to his beloved home. In this project we plan to learn Unity as best as we can using C# as the main coding language.
