# No-Bullets-Needed
## Description
This is a 2D rougelike shooter game that uses the Unity Game Engine. The concept of our game is a lone cowboy drifting in the wild west, but suddenly he gets taken to a fantasy world. With no bullets in his gun he must survive. Our protagonist is given a special glove that can take magic and convert it into bullets. Using his new found power, he must find a way back to his beloved home. In this project we plan to learn Unity as best as we can using C# as the main coding language.

## Our Motivation
Our motivation for this project is our love for video games, especially the rougelike, the adventure, and the shooter category. We got the idea of 2D rougelike game from a few games that we have played. For example, Enter the Gungeon, Vampire Survivors, 20 Minutes Till Death, Survivor.io, and more. Also, from our experience from previous projects like OLOL Battlegrounds, we have learned that creating games is actually really fun! 

## Skills and Techniques Used
Skills and techniques we have used in this project is our experience with C# and classes. We put split the functions and components of the games into managable steps for a smoother work flow. We also used a lot of our learning skills from learning Visual Studio Code into Unity. Especially finding useful tutorials and websites.
